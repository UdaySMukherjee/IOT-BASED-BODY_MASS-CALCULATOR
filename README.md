# IOT-BASED-BODY_MASS-CALCULATOR

# About the Project

A machine to measure the BMI (Body Mass Index) of a person standing on it . It is an IoT based machine thus it will be connected through the phone and will help the doctors to take the measure of the patient’s BMI  without going in close proximity to the patient thus making this product highly conducive in the present times and also for the future also. This is made portable thus a source of zeal to the health enthusiasts . In the present times due to the excessive intake of fast food cooked in unhygienic conditions and usage of unhealthy products is leading to a major threat to the health of the people and being obese is now becoming a mainstream problem . 

# Background

The rapid change in the lifestyle of people , the perpetual degradation of the food quality and the expeditive transformation of habits of people from home cooked food to either packaged food or fast food is leading to serious problems. There is a major threat of obesity that is posing the entire humankind . Obesity leads to a chain of other problems starting from heart diseases to even heightened osteoarthritis and many more . Obesity gradually leads to a steep decline in our body’s immunity to diseases and our body’s ability to respond to medicines . Obesity comes with an inevitable fate of loosing the fitness partially if not fully .

The BMI calculators available online needs us to give the weight , height , age and gender of the individual to calculate the BMI and all those data can be wrong as given by the user. So our product which is made potable solves this problem and being an IoT based project it will also facilitate us to get all the data in utmost precision in our smart phones with which we can keep a track of our health in regular basis . Due to the bad sitting habits and long hours of work leads to deterioration of our health , thus keeping a track of the data will prove to be beneficial . In this modern unpredictable world we must keep all these data which can also predict some upcoming danger based on sudden changes in BMI . This data also helps us to combat serious diseases in many cases if not all.

Body Mass Index is one of the most important data as perceived by the health enthusiasts and the fitness models mainly . They have to maintain a healthy lifestyle and that in-turn intends to maintaining a Normal BMI  . But the existing products are not portable and we cannot use that data when we get off from the machine , this is a real problem . So , to solve this problem our machine serves the purpose as it can calculate the measure of the BMI when the person is standing on the machine and then sends the data to the smart devices which can likely keep the data for a lifetime provided it receives that amount of disk storage from the user’s end . 

In most of the countries in the world there are contrasting pictures present . Few segments of the society suffers from excessive obesity and the polar opposite segment of the society suffers from acute malnutrition . It is not possible for all those people to buy a machine for checking the BMI , but as this is affordable enough for the middle class people , they can help the aforementioned people with which they can check their BMI . If underweight there are chances of many diseases like that of Anaemia , Osteoporosis and many more . 

## OBJECT OF INVENTION

The IoT based BMI calculator lets us measure the BMI accurately to highest precisions possible and as it is an IoT based project thus it gets connected with our smartphones , making tracking of data very easy over a long period of time.

## A SUMMARY OF INVENTION

IoT based BMI calculating machine falls in the healthcare sector . It is an IoT based product thus it is connected to our smartphones and any other smart device according to our convenience in real time . It also generates a kind of prescription depending on the condition of the user . The prescription contains some basic general recommendations that can be followed by anyone of that particular age . It is made portable , thus it is very handy and can be carried very easily in very compact space .  It also gives the user the option to store the data of the BMI in the disk storage provided by the user , depending on the disk storage the user can store the data for a lifetime .

FIG1: shows the top view of our device. The platform shown houses the
mechanism required to measure the weight and hence, the BMI of the user.
Thus, the platform is the key component of our module. Just like any other
weighing device, the user has to stand on the platform and the weight will be
displayed on the associated mobile application.

FIG2: shows the full 3d view of the device. The adjustable height scale allows
the user to measure his height accurately by moving the height bar up or down
accordingly. The measured height is displayed accordingly on the connected
mobile application.

FIG3: shows the main profile of the associated mobile application. The
application is connected via a microcontroller. The app displays the measured
height, weight, the BMI and the corresponding health status of the user, i.e.,
whether he is overweight, underweight or in perfect health conditions.
Additionally, a prescription is provided indicating the current health status of
the person and some extra information about what improvements that can be
added to his lifestyle.
